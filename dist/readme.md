## Installation
Clone the repository onto your local machine and then run `npm install` to install all associated Node packages. While in your terminal run `node server` to start the server.js file. Once you've received the confirmation in your terminal then you can open your desired browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port-server-is-active-on>` using the port your terminal states is in use for this application. The active server port should default to `3001` unless your terminal states otherwise.

## Usage
Once you're on the landing page click `Get Started` to navigate to the notes page. You can begin by clicking on the empty text field in the right hand panel OR by clicking on the pen icon in the upper right hand corner. Once you've entered in a desired note title and text you can click on the save icon that appears next to the pen icon. This will save your note for future use.
