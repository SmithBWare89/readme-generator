# [Professional Readme Generator](http://www.github.com/SmithBWare89/readme-generator)

## Description
This project is a part of the coursework for the University of Central Florida coding bootcamp. It's aimed at utilizing Node and javascript to be able to run a program using the command line. Users are asked a series of questions that are generated using the "Inquirer" package and then given the option to immediately view their generated readme. I hope that this will be able to assist individuals as well as myself in the future by making the creation of a professional readme simple, quick, and easy.
